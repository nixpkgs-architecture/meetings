## Notes

- [`readDir` perf questions](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/17)
  - Alex checked on macOS, also seems fine there
    - Darwin and Linux both batch and include the file type in the read dir entry --- perf is good.
    - other issue might have been due to unrelated thing
      - e.g. accidental coppying to the store.
  - The PR for lazy `stat`-ing no longer need block simple package paths, or a Nixpkgs arch team concern, but it is still a fine PR Alex/John/Robert/etc. can persue separately.

- Sharding questions
  - Should measure
  - Also listing file vs dir measure
    - new issue https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/23 assigned to Alex.
  - worst case, we can keep a file like all-packages.nix, but make it machine readable / machine editted / completely uniform.

- Discuss https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/20 a bit
  - detailed design is more declarative
  - questions on what should be CI
    - exact rules about refined, "shadowing unit files by accident" is bad, but overriding them (e.g. for bootstrapping) fine.
    - Don't need to separately worry about `pkg-fun.nix` `callPackage`-ing.
  - John wrote a new alternative to demonstrate our overall process/methodology


- For discussion
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/207893
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/207061
  - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/shrinkwrap-taming-dynamic-shared-objects/18224
  - https://discourse.nixos.org/t/making-runpath-redundant-for-nix/21631


## Action items

- everbody: Go through the entire RFC draft in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths and make a PR for anything that needs changing

- @growpotkin to test https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/23

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinisil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.
  - Ask git too, maybe. They do for `.git/objects`.
    - @growpotkin: I'd be shocked if GitHub knew implementation details of `git` objects.



## Unit CI Audits
This should get moved to a repo or something.
Just a draft for some CI checks for unit dirs.

```bash
#! /usr/bin/bash

set -eu;
set -o pipefail;

# All Shard Dirs must be 1-4 chars.
if [[ 0 -lt "$(
  find ./unit -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -print  \
    |grep -qv '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]\{1,4\}$'           \
    |wc -l;
  )"
]]; then
  echo "You blew it" >&2;
  exit 1;
fi

# All members of shard dir must have prefix.
for d in $( find ./unit -maxdepth 1 -type d -print; ); do
  if [[ 0 -lt "$(
    find "$d" -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -print  \
      |grep -qv "${d//./\\.}.*"                       \
      |wc -l;
    )"
  ]]; then
    echo "You blew it in shard dir: $d" >&2;
    exit 2;
  fi
done

# Eval must succeed without referring to `../` paths.
for p in $( find ./unit -type f -name pkg-fun.nix -print; ); do
  # Something like:
  nix eval --show-trace -f <( cat "$p"; ) --apply 'pf: let
    nixpkgs = builtins.getFlake "nixpkgs";
    system  = builtins.currentSystem;
    pkgsFor = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}
  in builtins.seq ( pkgsFor.callPackage pf {} ).drvAttrs true
  ';
done
```
