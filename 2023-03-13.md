## Notes

### [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)

- Finding a shepherd proves hard. Co-authors are excluded by the rfc process. Ways forward, choice:
  - Sketchy: remove some authors. @roberth would be the(?) co-author. Defeats the RFC process.
  - Talk to the steering the committee for an exception
- @j-k is interested in this RFC
- @infinisil summarizes the RFC. questions:
  - @j-k: possible confusion around single character packages
     - @infinisil: rare edge case
- Going to change pkg-fun -> package
- Lots of positive reactions
- Inviting meeting guests to shepherd
  - @j-k: how does the implementation fit into this?
     - @infinisil: the RFC team is only concerned with the improving and accepting of the RFC
  - @j-k: what if they like it but there are concerns about performance? Can the RFC be accepted on e.g. the condition that performance is evaluated/improved?
     - @infinisil: performance has already been evaluated
- Generally bi-weekly meetings. There will be a shepherd leader. [I suppose details can be looked up]
  - @j-k: confirms that he intends to nominate himself. Doubts about exact responsibilities
     - It's a bit administrative lead role. [Not too complicated]
- The RFC is blocked on the RFC process for now.

### [Package modules](https://pad.lassul.us/lr4EhSckTJSByDLBLcm_-w#) workgroup

- @infinisil: We've made a start writing a [problem description](https://pad.lassul.us/lr4EhSckTJSByDLBLcm_-w#) / discourse announcement for the module based packages idea

- @infinisil: Would like to resume this after the call

- @infinisil: Plan to work on the RFC in a repo ([as in RFC 138](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/138))

- @j-k: interested in helping out
  - overlay style mkDerivation argument comes to mind
  - "matrix" parameters come to mind, e.g. source dependent on `system`

- @infinisil: We're going to explore and find out what we can do

- @roberth: How can Nixpkgs support DavHau's efforts as they are? Support other configuration systems. Better separation of concerns

- @infinisil: Recalls the team's commitment to focus on one thing at NixCon 2022. It helps to make a small step

### [RFC 140 tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp) work

- @infinisil: Would like some help with nix-spp. Wanja is joining later today, 7 PM CET

- If you have time during the week, feel free to contribute.

### Review `mkDerivation` [`__cleanAttrs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217243)

- @infinisil: What about third-party users of e.g. hello.buildInputs?
  - @roberth: Should get away from this at some point, we don't really know these values anyways
- @qyliss: `.overrideAttrs` still needs to work
  - @roberth: Does still work, attributes are stored internally
- @qyliss: Can you use `.overrideAttrs` to disable `cleanAttrs`?
  - @roberth: Yes :)
- @qyliss: Makes it easier to debug
- @Ericson2314: Interacts nicely with module-based packages, can't return to original args once called. Small step towards many good things (@roberth agrees)
  - @Adam: `.overrideAttrs` wouldn't work on module-created packages?
  - @Ericson2314: Yes (..?)
  - @Adam: I feel like there's always some cases that the module system can't cover
  - @roberth: There's `extendModules`
  - @Adam: Need to be able to do things like e.g. removing things with a predicate from cflags
  - @roberth: Will be possible, with mkForce and the old value that's already in lexical scope
  - @Ericson2314/infinisil: We always need to support the necessary use-cases
- @infinisil: Does `.drvAttrs` still work?
  - @roberth: `.internal` is the same as `.drvAttrs`
  - @infinisil: What about providing backwards-compat?
  - @Ericson2314: It's opt-in, you're choosing to break your consumers
  - @infinisil: No defined API to Nixpkgs, people might not know about it meaning to be internal
  - @Ericson2314: Forking road, we're deciding what is stable and what isn't
  - @infinisil: Keeping attributes and throwing a warning for a release would not be very expensive
  - @roberth: Could look into that, three-value variable, either `false`, `true`, or `"warn"
  - @infinisil: Can include link in the error message for getting more feedback
  - @roberth: We can figure out the final interface better like this

### After the meeting time slot

- @qyliss: [Rust fetching change](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217084) don't have any stats yet, let's discuss next time
  - Space is similar to Haskell, probably
  - @infinisil: 10M Nixpkgs increase is for everyone
  - ... discussion of rust dependency management situation ...
  - @qyliss: We need dependency info in order to execute on security updates. Not something we can do in the current situation.

## Action items

- document Team + Working groups change

- @infinisil will continue writing [the tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp)
