## Notes

### Finding a new meeting time
Let's use CET, an hour later than the current meeting at least, creating when2meet
- "WET/WEST"? western european time

### Next steps for auto-called packages RFC draft
- did anyone do a perf check?
- @tomberek: been using a container to test lazy-trees
  - Read dir might get more information than needed, e.g. modification time, and modification time is in the zip file, something like that
  - @infinisil: If lazy trees causes problems then it has bigger problems
  - @tomberek: `builtins.readDir` does a stat call on each entry to figure out if it's a directory/file/symlinks!
  - <https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/src/libexpr/primops.cc#L1644-L1653>
  - @infinisil: Can easily optimize in the future
  - @tomberek: Only slow the first time, then linux cache
  - @tomberek: `readDir` is compatible with pure flakes btw
  - @tomberek: we need some actual numbers to understand the tradeoff
      - eg: all-packages.nix LOC: -5% of original, eval time +7%
  - @infinisil: start with simplest tooling
  - @infinisil: will ping people when starting a mob programming session
- @tomberek Can test performance on various platforms and filesystems, Nix versions etc.
