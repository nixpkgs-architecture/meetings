## Notes

### In-person meeting at Nixcon

Meeting notes by @tomberek: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/meetings/blob/master/2022-10-21.md

@infinisil acting as the leader of the team was approved by the present members

### growpotkin Ameen would like to join the team

Motivation:

- Loves Nix so much
- has used it many years
- has lots of appreciation for everything that has kept that giant monorepo running

Waiting for application in channel (update: was done later)

### The Nixpkgs Architecture Team is on nixos.org now

@Ericson2314: Per https://nixos.org/community/index.html#governance-teams it looks like we need a logo

### Problems with RFC 127

- @Ericson2314 Shouldn't change mechanism and policy at the same time
  - Great we have a better way to write these things with RFC
  - No point bogging that down with an orthogonal change about what "deprecation" means

- @Ericson2314 It may well be that we want a "hard deprecation" that is "off by default" (c.f. unfree is opt-in not opt-out), but can also have "soft deprecation" which is a mere warning.

- @tomberek: no opinion on this

- @roberth, don't want to make drama weighing in too strongly as team

- @Ericson2314: we can express a "team opinion" while make clear we don't have any formal veto / they don't have to listen to us.

- @roberth: That sounds good

- @growpotkin: It's all about the tone!
 
- @infinisil: Agrees with this

### JSON schema for NixOS options

@Profpatsch proposed to have a JSON schema for NixOS options, which would allow them to be written with auto-completion in a JSON file. @DavHau, @nbp, @whentze and @piegames were also involved in the discussion. At Nixcon @Profpatsch hacked on this.

- @infinisil: Seems cool, but doesn't need support from the team

- @Ericson2314: Did he ask for some sort of assistence?

- @infinisil: Don't think so, just wanted us to be aware

- @Ericson2314: Fair enough. Eventually could lead to interesting questions about what the "interfaces" between the module system and external world should be, but no rush for us to tackling that.

### Type-checked wrapped fetchers experiment

- @infinisil and @aakropotkin free-flowing discussion on this as demo

- @Ericson2314 worried about creating more runtime type checking systems. Put more pressure on other teams adding types. [@tomberek]: +1

- @growpotkin actually agrees, do not recommend putting this type checking thing upstream, just done "for his own sanity"
   - Some of the utilities however used to write it might go in `lib`
- @infinisil Good to reorganize `lib` too at some point
- @growpotkin agrees

### Handling argument escaping with setup hooks

- @Ericson2314: is `buildNpmPackage` deduplicatd with the new setup hooks? Hard requirement from me

- @infinisil: points out issue with the setup hook and escaping. Wonders we have a new solution

- @Ericson2314: Wants us to stick with ugly but already in use solution that `makeFlags` vs `makeFlagsArray` uses.
    - Ugly, but good to stick with established conventions
    - structured attrs long term should help, solve this properly

- @growpotkin: Agrees
    - Trying to "defensively quote" can get confusing, error-prone
    - `*Array` is ugly but reliable.
