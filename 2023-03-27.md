## Notes

### [RFC 140 Authors and Shepherds situation](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140#discussion_r1149458540)

- Change co-authors from "The Nixpkgs Archicture Team" to specific people
- Because we are short on shepherds, nominate more people from the team
   - Still prefer non-team members are shepherds in order to get more outside feedback, but if no one is volunteering don't just want the RFC to stall.
- Alex agrees to nominate as a shepherd!

### Working group member search: Module system for packages

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/working-group-member-search-module-system-for-packages/26574

- There is an announcement
- Invite a bunch of people
- Create Matrix channel (Edit: [Requested on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!rMMJVYqfOEOLttKGza:nixos.org/$ZhcsRcHs6_7om_UYjEaXQveP8d64soeShRfepyKhOVU?via=nixos.org&via=matrix.org&via=nixos.dev))
- When to kick off with additional members?
  - A week?
  - Actually now.
- Creating when2meet to schedule meeting
- @growpotkin and @Infinisil: Not sure on whether "live" working is better or worse
  - So try to find some sort of compromise
- Edit: @infinisil will initiate things
