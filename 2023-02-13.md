## Notes

### [`pkg-fun.nix` vs. other names](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140#discussion_r1090915765)

- Going over alternatives from the RFC thread.

- @infinisil: likes `package.nix` the best.
  - concurs:
    - @growpotkin
    - @Ericson2314
    - @roberth
  - @tomberek has small quibble
    - thing with arguments of dependencies is a more general pattern that does work with `callPackage`

  - @Ericson2314, @roberth, @infinsil: That is is very true, but perhaps as we purposely restricting the scope of the first version of units, this is OK.
    - e.g. if/when units were moved out of `/pkg` to the top level, that would be a good time to reconsider.

  - @tomberek the `default.nix` being used today does show continuity

  - @Ericson2314: In fairness to that, the problem with default's behavior is the CLI, the importing part is fine. The new CLI could just not have this problem.

  - @roberth: but `default` is a still a bad name, and `callPackage` semantics and auto-call semantics is not the same.

  - @tomberek: `package.nix` is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation

  - @infinisil: Good for beginnners just learning the things.
  
  - @Ericson2314: `callPackage` could special-case `package.nix`. Or a `callUnitPackage` that *enforces* this an any other invariants we want.
    - @infinisil:
      ```
      callUnitRoot ./pkgs/unit -> {
        packages = ...;
        modules = ...;
      }
      ```

  - Consensus: `package.nix` is good!

### Split into two implementation PR's

Have a first nixpkgs PR that introduces the mechanism and tries it out on a couple packages, let people try it out, have Hydra build it, etc. This way we can iron out bugs.

After all problems are confirmed to be fixed, another PR for the treewide change is merged.

Consensus:
- @tomberek
- @roberth
- @Ericson2314 --- appetizer then main course!
- @growpotkin
