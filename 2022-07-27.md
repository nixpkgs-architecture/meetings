## Discussion

### `stdenv.mkDerivation`

- @DavHau: Experimenting with module system based `stdenv.mkDerivation` redesign: https://github.com/DavHau/build-modules
  - Only depends on nixpkgs lib
  - Bootstraps by itself on some bootstrap binaries
  - Build-time interpreter, replacable with something other than bash, tried micropython
  - Should be easy to bootstrap (@Gytis: micropython does not seem to be easy to boostrap)
  - Trying not to use env variables, only use json for communication between Nix and build and phases
  - Uses module system, no more override functions, flexible
  - Multiple build phases possible
  - @infinisil: Dag? @DavHau: No still linear
- @DavHau: All phases can be rendered into individual derivations
  - Output of one phase is the input of the next one
  - @infinisil: Single derivation for lots of builds, multiple derivations for debugging
  - @qyliss: Copying necessary?
  - @DavHau: No, can write to a random path in the sandbox
  - @qyliss: Most build phases involve modifying source root
  - @John: Copy should be cheap too with a COW file system
  - @infinisil: Generally files are just created, not modified, COW might work well
  - @qyliss: COW often doesn't work because /nix/store is a different filesystem than build directory (usually /tmp). Could be fixed by changing Nix to have a build dir in /nix/store
  - @John: We should make nixpkgs for the Nix we wish we had, since such problems are fixable
  - @infinisil: There's already a lot of potential for nixpkgs improvements, let's not focus on changing Nix
  - @John: Shouldn't get into the weeds of fixing Nix, but if we can improve the correctness of Nix for the benefit of nixpkgs let's go for it
  - @ashkitten: Concerned if we ignore performance implications, Hydra as well, already very expensive. Performance regression tracking
  - @qyliss: nixpkgs eval is already really slow, more so for cross. Not a lot of work for optimizing eval time. Only eval cache in Flakes, doesn't work for small differences. Is somebody concerned going forward?
  - @Gytis: Splitting phases should be out of scope, adds a lot of complexity, there are better ways of dealing with this
  - @John: @qyliss: Eval is cursed, store layer is more salvageable. Performance shouldn't get in the way of performance
  - @qyliss: @Gytis: Splitting phases is very necessary, e.g. source only function, to get source with patches applied, useful for checking out source, AGPL compliance.
    - @Gytis: Just out of scope of new builder infra, very complex, better ways to achieve it
    - @qyliss: Second system without phases separation will leads us to never being able to do certain things
  - @Dandellion: Use computed derivations? https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/92
    - @John: Can use those, but doesn't make it easier. More like a parallel, next version thing, very different spirit
  - @DavHau: Phase splitting would allow better integration with tools like `nix-shell`. Currently phases modified during build time. While learning Nix, even after understanding Nix code in nixpkgs, build time phases were still hard to understand. Reinventing this should be in scope
  - @Robert: Phases currently are inherently imperative. Should have something like phases. Tangent: `nix develop` architecturally sub-optimal, not working with sandbox, assumes specific implementation of nixpkgs
  - @tomberek: How far should the splitting go? Would be valuable, split up things too big. Improves derivation iteration. Could use that feature for production too. Could easily be abused
  - @ashkitten: overlayfs instead of copying?
    - @qyliss: Experimented with it, overlayfs works slightly differently from normal filesystems, breaks stuff in subtle ways, can't really fix ourselves, fundamental limitation
  - @infinisil: Split derivation only at the root, create build code to simulate isolation between derivations within a single one
    - @DavHau: Tried with dream2nix something like this, worked well
  - @qyliss: Dynamic split/combined should also work, would be nice to do it without copying too much
  - @DavHau: Hopes to be able to experiment with it
  - @qyliss: Skeptical of worrying about performance later, especially for eval performance. Can't do much about it. Module system is especially bad for it. (@roberth, @Gytis: +1). Can't do anything requiring significantly more eval. Not sure about module system "spooky action at a distance"
    - @David: Being able to access every option from every other
    - @John: Ambient authority problem, hard to scale, against using the module system
    - @Gytis: Module system per package
    - @infinisil: Happens to some degree already with submodules
    - @Gytis: Module system could be improved upon
    - @infinisil: I don't think the module system can be sped up a lot, already fairly optimized
    - @Gytis: this should improve modules systems performance https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/5403
  - @ashkitten: Regarding redesigning setup hooks. Relates to being able to use a single NixOS module multiple times, wanting to run a phase multiple times
  - @John: At some point one should properly look into eval performance. As long as we end up with final in-store derivations  results that look like we want. Less important what input looks like, output derivations more important, less rebuilds. Graph of derivations. Doing this makes a lot of things less daunting
  - @roberth: Relates to https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/3
    - @infinisil: @David used this as inspiration
  - @Gytis: Implemented something just like that, https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/nix-reinventing-the-wheel/ Can build something, no cross compilation or bootstrapping, but uses json, phases have indices, makes smaller phases easier and overrides easier
  - @infinisil: Let's go over these redesigns next time and closely look at them
