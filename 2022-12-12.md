## Notes

### https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/7447

- Should we do full `stat`?
  - @Ericson2314: Seems like a good idea if it is just the info in Nix's restricted file system model.
  - @growpotkin: Should be a separate PR/builtin
  - @growpotkin: Playing devil's advocate, sometimes useful to check executable on direction in particular
    - @Ericson2314: Oh wait, that convinces me the opposite! Directories do not have exe bit in Nix's model, so we shouldn't be able to see that with primop.
  -  avoiding a derivation if it's not necessary to fix up the permission bitsexe
  - @infinisil: Use case for checking executable bit at eval time?
  - @infinisil: Alternative: Make the primop internal, not accessible at first
    - @roberth: Can be done, but a bit of a shame not, do have [an issue for a path type builtin](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7314)
  - @growpotkin: Some cost to allocating attribute for returning multiple properties
  - @roberth: Let's keep it simple with `pathType` for now, can have `pathInfo` later.

- What is the perf situation?
  - Linux is fast regardless
     - Fast on growpotkin's machine either way
     - @Ericson2314: Most file systems will return the info with the dir entry and so this change is dead code.
  - Needs to be tested on Darwin
   - @Ericson2314: Scared that we still have no idea what made things slow on Darwin.
   - @growpotkin: Never scared, *arms crossed*   

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- Scans Nix files for paths
- Prints files which are only referenced from `pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix`
- @infinisil: Should interface be general?
  - @wanja: Fine to be one off
  - @Ericson2314: Agreed. The code can be nice when it's easy to do so -- ready to go in a library e.g., but the CLI we can not bother to generalize prematurely.

## Action items

- @Ericson2314 and @growpotkin will continue with https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/7447, especially testing it on Darwin

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinisil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.

  - Ask git too, maybe. They do for `.git/objects`.
