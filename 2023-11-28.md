## Notes

- @phaer leaves the team
- Nixpkgs updates
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/269551
    - Better error message when trying to run unpatched binaries
    - General agreement to have it
    - Touches `lib.systems`
      - roberth: Maybe structure it as components, each with their own maintainers, doc chapters, etc
         - core (`attrsets`, `lists`, `strings`, etc.)
         - module system (`options`, `modules`, `types`)
         - systems (`systems`)
      - Issue opened: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/270666
      - Maybe shouldn't be in `lib`, but rather `stdenv`
        - Potential future work to move it to a better place and document it
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/269356
    - Potential to fix the ofborg eval slowness (with follow-up PR)
  - https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/166
  - https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/146
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/252057 should be discussed a bit more
  - `lib.fileset` library, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/264541 for a potential function to work on arbitrary store paths
- Update on [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)
  - @infinisil will continue with https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/258650
  - Can ping @DavHau
- Package set unification? https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/21
  - @infinisil doesn't have the time, somebody else has to pick it up
  - @tomberek: Considering doing that, worth doing?
    - @infinisil: 100% agree worth doing, exactly the thing for the NAT!
  - @DavHau: Do unification of package overriding first?
    - @infinisil: Intermediate unified package sets will help with future improvements to overriding
    - @tomberek: I want it to be teachable to beginners, currently intractable
- @ashkitten: Various ways to update packages, would be good to have a unified way that works, maybe even builtin
  - @infinisil: Relates to flake lockfile and dream2nix
  - @roberth: Nix team perspective: team has no bandwidth or scope do anything specific to Nixpkgs or write to files. Could use `nix run` or provide some command.
  - `maintainers/scripts/update.nix` is kind of terrible, would be great to change it to a normal script
    - @roberth: A script with a better UX would be great and not controversial
  - `passthru.updateScript` standardisation work would be great
  - @r-ryantm uses https://github.com/Mic92/nix-update, relates to https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-nixpkgs-merge-bot/34265
    - Great RFC topic for somebody
  - @ashkitten interested in working on update script standardisation: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/24
- @tomberek: possible to expose the full scope of callPackge through a lazy value (may be related to the package set uni.). Garbage collection is likely impacted.
  ```
  package.passthru.context 
  package.overrideAttrs
  package.override
  -
  callPackageWith package.context ./default.nix {}
  
  callPackage ./hello.nix {
    python = python3;
  }
  ```
  - @DavHau: Maybe better to fix the underlying reason why it's hard to reproduce packages
  - @infinisil: Please describe it in an issue
