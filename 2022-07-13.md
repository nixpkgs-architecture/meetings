### Revise team organization

- Other problems:
  - @kevin: Single broken packages are a pain in nixos because they're a nested dependency
  - @ashkitten: Going from external overriding/overlays to nixpkgs PRs is not straightforward
  - @yorik: Builders being more composable and system-agnostic, nixpkgs and nix side
      - https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6697 WASM/WASI?
      - Work with Nix developers, very intrusive into nixpkgs
  - @Mindavi: Bringing native, cross, static compilation closer together
      - @Gytis: Already fairly well supported
      - @infinisil: Somebody has to do the work
      - @Gytis: Test common compilation options, like x86_64-linux to aarch64-linux
          - @David: Not done by hydra yet, not a release blocker
      - @Mindavi: More concerned about e.g. prefixing pkg-config for cross-compilation only
          - @infinisil: So it's implemented somewhat hackily
      - @David: strictDeps

  - @Gytis: callPackage needed for cross compilation to work, spliced packages
  - @infinisil: structured attrs
      - @yorik: Goes into mkDerivation topic
  - @ashkitten: Traditional dev workflows don't work on NixOS
      - Tools are hard to get outside of nix-shell's
      - @Gytis: Generic dev shells for things like cross comp, toolchains
      - @infinisil: Adding /lib to NixOS, dynamic linkers
          - @Gytis: Probably not a good idea, decreases PR quality
      - @infinisil: NixOS isn't as much of a problem, but can also be looked at

- Process
    - @yorik: Not having many members is a feature, as it allows reaching consensus at all
    - @j-k: People without reason might say they have reason
        - @j-k: Another word for reason? Might have people taking discussion off-topic
        - @Mindavi: If someone is not fit they might not know about them being unreasonable
        - @mkaito: Prefer facts and first-hand experience over emotions
        - @mkaito: Emotions might be hard to hold back
        - @j-k: Could have two reasonable people but have different opinions
        - @infinisil: Comes from different values
    - @mkaito: Complete consensus is a unicorn. Nixpkgs should continue with growth, shouldn't get worse. Goal is nixpkgs, not to have ones solution implemented
    - @ashkitten: Not immediately reaching optimal solution, but more iterative and more agreeable, at least better than nothing change. http://new-compass.net/articles/against-consensus-dissensus
    - @mkaito: Most problems are social, not technical
    - @infinisil: Change process "consensus"
        - @mkaito: Strive to consensus
        - @yorik: Consider all points of views in order to reach consensus. Willing to compromise
        - @mkaito: Goal is best for future nixpkgs, should be able to reach

- Team
    - @yorik: Matrix is very synchronous, should have more asynchronous, maybe more github for asynchronous
        - @Gytis: Matrix is only for one discussion at a time, hard to follow
        - @infinisil: Beta feature of threads?
        - @mkaito: Not great
        - @Mindavi: Discourse?
        - @infinisil: Make communication methods more flexible
        - @qyliss: Long github discussions don't work well (see RFCs). Discourse doesn't have that problem
    - @tomberek: What's the responsibilities and authorities of the team. Needs both
        - @tomberek: E.g. maintain things as responsibility
        - @ashkitten: authority via RFCs and implementing it
        - @mkaito: authority comes from responsibility
