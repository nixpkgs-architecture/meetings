## Notes

### [Should PRs follow new convention?](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/24)

- For some period accept both old and new convention.
- Should reviewers require the new convention?
- @Ericson2314: This sounds like an edge case, possibly overcomitting.

- @growpotkin and @Ericson2314:
  - New PRs of new code should follow the new convention.
  - Old PRs predating the convention (that should have gotten review earlier) should not be penalized.

- Infinisil: Well the automated tool can handle the new code so maybe it's not so bad?
  - @growpotkin & @Ericson2314: Well then the tool is committing itself to handle arbitrary simple PRs *going forward* rather than just the old stuff that already exists.
  - @infinisil: 
  - @Ericson2314: The PR auther can also use the tools to migrate their own PR / be responsible for fixing anything that doens't match it.
  - @infinisil: Do we need any changes then?

- Newly added packages ought to follow new conventions, existing packages can be
  updated without migration.
  - Use common sense, etc.

- Non-gating PR checks to report whether a package can be auto-migrated.
  - Gray check indicates failure, but won't block a PR.

- Make it less restrictive by removing check #2, let people migrate all the packages they want

### [`builtins.unsafeGetAttrPos` breakage with `unit/`](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/25)

- Moving packages causes breakage to `builtins.unsafeGetAttrPos`.
- @growpotkin: Not a serious issue. It's "unsafe" - you were told.
- @roberth: Seems like they misunderstood the routine. Non-issue.
- @Ericson2314: Non-issue.
- Finding packages should be a non-issue because they can be located
  in their `unit/` directory "by name".

## Action items

- everbody: Go through the entire RFC draft in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths and make a PR for anything that needs changing
  - Check here when done: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/26

- @growpotkin to test https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/23
  - Create flat and sharded directories (with counts 10000, 100000, 1000000)
  - Turn the directories to a single attribute set
    - `hyperfine nix-instantiate --eval -E 'builtins.seq { < the set > } null'`

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinisil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.
  - Ask git too, maybe. They do for `.git/objects`.
    - @growpotkin: I'd be shocked if GitHub knew implementation details of `git` objects.
