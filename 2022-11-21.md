## Notes

- @infinisil shows https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/auto-called-packages/pull/15
  - merge it!

- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/16
  - agree to close as fixed / no action needed (will be in RFC)

- @Ericson2314: `src.nix` can be separate from `pkg-fun.nix`
  - @growpotkin: Yes yes yes 

- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/14
   - relative path ../../..
     - agree to try to fix in script
   - Various issues with multiple versions
     - @Ericson2314: let's just skip packages with multiple versions for now
       - wary of having `foo` and `foo123` units
       - wary of `unit/foo` but `foo = foo6`
     - @infinisil: OK sounds good 

- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/9
  - @infinisil: let's just make package sets within nixpkgs out of scope
    - @Ericson2314: agreed
  - @growpotkin: but if individual packages are in CODEOWNERS we should upgrade
    - all: agreed

- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/17 read dir perf
  - https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7314 related nix issue

  - getdents is also on FreeBSD, maybe macOS, not just linux.

  - O(...) thinking:

    x is disk access time
    y is memory allocation time
    n is the number of top-level attributes
    
    Before: O(x * stat + y * n)
    After: O(x * stat * n + y * n)
    After (with OS support): O(x * stat + y * n)
    After (with lazy readDir): O(x * stat + y * n)

- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/1
  - let's shard
  - @growpotkin @Ericson2314: Should be fixed-prefix, makes it much easier
    - 2-prefix, li has 1500 entries
      - 2/2-prefix, libpng -> li/bp/libpng/pkg-fun.nix
      - lzma -> lz/ma/lzma/pkg-fun.nix, what about packages with the same prefix?
      - lzmalzma -> lz/ma/lzmalzma/pkg-fun.nix
      - lz -> lz/lz/pkg-fun.nix
      - lz -> lz/_unscoped/pkg-fun.nix
      - Single-letter packages: [ "R" "h" "j" "o" "q" "t" ]

    - a and a_b package attributes goes into a_ prefix
      
    - 1-letter packages `x-/--/x/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 2-letter packages `xy/--/xy/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 3-letter packages `xy/z-/xyz/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 4-letter packages `xy/zw/xyzw/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 5-letter packages `xy/zw/xyzwa/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 6-letter packages `xy/zw/xyzwab/pkg-fun.nix`
    - 7-letter packages `xy/zw/xyzwabc/pkg-fun.nix`


    - 6+ packges  5pkgs/xy/zw/ab/xyzwab/pkg-fun.nix
  
    - log_(26^2) 40,0000 ~= 4.6020599913

      
    - Largest directories by prefix length for top-level attributes
      - 1: 1606
      - 2: 1173
      - 3: 950 (just below GitHub's 1000 limit, might go over with some more packages)
      - 4: 236 (comfortably below the 1000 limit)
        - haskellPackages: 202
        - pythonPackages: 182
        - perlPackages: 136
    - Nixpkgs has on the order of 10'000 packages per package set and 100'000 packages in total

    - 2/2 or 4 prefix?
      - With 4 prefix we have 536 prefix-directories
        - 1 packages `x---/x/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 2 packages `xy--/xy/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 3 packages `xyz-/xyz/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 4 packages `xyzw/xyzw/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 5 packages `xyzw/xyzwa/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 6 packages `xyzw/xyzwab/pkg-fun.nix`
        - 7-lettt packages `xyzw/xyzwabc/pkg-fun.nix`

        - Can't be misinterpreted as a flag, there's no packages starting with a `-`
        - `_0ve/_0verkill/pkg-fun.nix`, already a problem with windows though, not a concern
      - Underscore looks better than `_`
      - But for `-` you don't have to hold shift for most keyboard layouts
      - If we used 2/2, we'd have to use more readDir calls, so 4-prefix is better in that regard
