## Notes

### Issues
#### Simple Package Paths
- @infinisil created PR associated with sharding directory names.
  - <https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/20>
  - Collected stats on how many packages fall into each substring category.
- Plan to use `builtins.substring 1 4 <PKG>.pname` to create shard-directory.
- Compatibility Layer
  - Emits warning for legacy style package names.
  - Should we use symlinks for legacy support?
    - @roberth okay with ignoring support for it
    - @blaggacao _if you build it, they will come_, if you allow legacy names with symlinks people will depend on that.
  - We don't need it!
    - @infinisil: +1
    - @Ericson2314: +1
    - @growpotkin +1
    - @roberth: +1

#### Is the tree an API?
- There's `pkgs.path`
  ```
  nixpkgs
  pkgs = import nixpkgs {}
  pkgs.path == nixpkgs
  ```

  Probably an anti-pattern, doesn't work as expected with overlays, config
- There's `meta.position` -> for debugging and tooling
- `modulesPath` -> NixOS module specific, but definitely part of the API, should have symlinks when/if we change those

#### numbers.nix
- @infinisil created a utility for collecting statistics about shard-directory members/tree: <https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/21>

#### `pkgs/unit/hell/hello/unstructured/test.nix`

<https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/19>

- Protected namespace for misc files associated with a package.
- Makes existing files with common names distinct from new "standardized" filenames.
  - Example: `test.nix` might exist in a package today, but may not follow standardized structure for "new" `pkgs/unit/<SHARD>/<PNAME>/test.nix` checks.
    - NOTE: I have no idea if `test.nix` is a prospective "standardized" file, I'm just providing an example.
  - @roberth: Since for now we only have packages, let's use a `pkg` subdirectory for all extra package-related files
    - @infinisil: +1
    - @growpotkin: Spell out `package` to avoid annoying completion?
      - @infinisil: pkg/fun.nix instead of pkg-fun.nix?
        - @roberth: Right direction. Goes into removing initial `pkgs` nesting, but we agreed to not do that
      - pfunk.nix???
    - @roberth: (implicit +1)
  - @Ericson2314: Missing default.nix a bit, who uses which subdirectory?
  - @roberth: pkg-fun/pkg-fun.nix?
  - @infinisil: Does it make sense to have a single file to import all dirs? I don't think so

Proposals:
  - pkgs/unit/gnum/gnumake
    - pkg-fun
      - pkg-fun.nix
      - foo.patch  (imported by pkg-fun.nix)
      - test.nix  (imported by pkg-fun.nix)

  - pkgs/unit/gnum/gnumake
    - pkg-fun.nix
    - pkg
      - foo.patch  (imported by ../pkg-fun.nix)
      - test.nix  (imported by ../pkg-fun.nix)

  - @Ericson2314: defer more conventions for later, incubate in nixpkgs, before making it a more standardized convention
  - pkgs/unit/gnum/gnumake (
    - pkg-fun.nix
    - foo.patch  (imported by pkg-fun.nix)
    - test.nix  (imported by pkg-fun.nix)

    - @growpotkin: +1
    - @roberth: +1
    - @Ericson2314: +1
    - @infinisil: +1

  - @infinisil: In the future, add versioning:
  - pkgs/unit/gnum/gnumake
    - .unit-version     -> Should be on a higher level, not package-specific, pkgs/.unit-version
    - pkg-fun.nix
    - pkg
      - foo.patch  (imported by ../pkg-fun.nix)
      - test.nix  (imported by ../pkg-fun.nix)

### Relative File References
- @infinisil don't want to create tooling to automatically fixup relative path `import` and other references.
- @infinisil recommends a strict boundary for references with a few rules:
    - No `import ../<PATH>`
    - References to "stuff" outside of the package dirs needs to be through function args.
    - Anything that currently requires fixup of `../` paths by hand, then the automated tooling will ignore them, leaving them to be manually rewritten later.

### Tooling

@infinisil: Tooling can be run on a commit history with `git filter-branch`
  We don't need to worry about old PRs too much
@growpotkin: Dry-run this!

No symlinks and no file changes are great for not triggering merge conflicts in lots of PRs
