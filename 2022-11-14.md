## Auto-called packages RFC draft review
proposal: package.nix instead of default.nix, <https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/auto-called-packages/pull/8>

- Benefit: Can't accidentally `nix-build` these paths anymore
  - Leaves room open for a `default.nix` that can be `nix-build`'t
- @Ericson2314: 
  - File paths are an implementation detail
  - We can do extra migrations out the kindness of our heart.
  - But we shoudln't feel "boxed in" by this. If we can't do as good of a "bonus" thing for downstream coe snooping at unstable file layouts, that's fine.
- @roberth: PR's need to be rebased, lots of them
  - @Ericson2314: PR's change the implementation, is expected. Tool to automate PR rebases has a lot of flexibilities

- zooming out, the choice is between
  - `package-function/<name>`
    - new stuff would be `foo/<name>`, `bar/<name>`.
  - `<name>/package-function`
    - new stuff would be `<name>/foo` `<name>/bar` - 
- Concretely:
  - Example: `pkgs/auto/hello/package-function.nix`
  - Example: `auto/hello/package-function.nix` ?
- @Ericson2314: directory should imply structure; avoid exceptions (+1)
  - What do do with bootstrap, build-support, etc?
  - What to do with fetchgit (things that are libraries are not exactly packages)
  - lib?
  - @tomberek: dir structure should be a close match to attr structure
  - during transition will have new/old separation
  - @infinisil: Proposal: Change the RFC to only do the transition for packages, not functions like fetchers and other special values
    - +1
    - +1
    - +1 @Ericson2314
  - @tomberek: The directory structure / attribute structure mismatch is currently confusing. Might be better to keep it the same
    
- might be controversial
- @growpotkin: Could use `default.nix` for filling out non-default arguments
  - @roberth: Doesn't scale to nixpkgs' scale. Can have `default.nix` be something like `(import ../.. {}).hello` instead though
  - @Ericson2314: 
    - Agreed we should save `default.nix` for things that are *not* footguns that cannot be called. A good general rule.
    - A bit wary about *this specific* default.nix, because definitions should not *know their own name*.
    - But perhaps it is less bad because the package directories were already supposed to be 1-1 with attribute names.


File name proposals:
- @roberth: Something with "fun"/"functions"
- pkg-fun.nix, same length as default.nix :)
  - +1 @Ericson2314
  - +1 @infinisil
  - @roberth: sounds good
  - @growpotkin: Sounds good, easy for tab completions
- Other ideas:
  - package-function.nix
  - package-fun.nix
  - package.nix
  - proto-derivation.nix
  - prototype.nix
  - blueprint.nix
  - default.nix
  - pkg.nix

- @Ericson2314: Naming details shouldn't block the RFC

## Directory root

In nixpkgs root:
- `pkg/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`
- `component/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`, too long
- `part/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`
- `thing/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`
- `mod/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`, we have modules already
- `pkg/<name>/pkg-fun.nix`

- `comp`
- `uniform`

- `unit`
  - +1 @infinisil
  - +1 @growpotkin
  - +1 @roberth
  - @Ericson2314 proposed `pkgs/unit/<name>/*.nix`
    - @roberth: `pkgs` not necessary.
    - @roberth: Implementation should include rename tool, shouldn't do many renames manually
    - @roberth: Doesn't make sense to move nixos modules into `pkgs`
      - @Ericson2314: +1
    - Not disagreeing with `pkgs/unit`, for now only for packages
  - `unit/<name>/*.nix`
  - @infinisil: Just a name
  - @Ericson2314: Good to think ahead, less ossifying, can change things later as well. We're trying to think ahead, but not set in stone.
  - @growpotkin strictness is flexibility!
     - @Ericson3214: +90000
  - @infinisil: Encouraging more evolution

## @growpotkin's sharding experiment

- Ran into some performance issues with `readDir`.
- Automatically generate single file with all paths, much faster.
  - @infinisil: `builtins.listDir` could be faster
    - @roberth: This is an implementation detail (and readDir attrValues can be made lazy)
- 8000 nodejs packages, sharding node packages by scope + base name, plus one-letter sharding for unscoped
- @Ericson2314: Attribute union should be faster in Nix, currently linear
- @Ericson2314: Fundamentally, we should do things like sharding because limitations in things outside our control, like the filesystem. When the implementation is in Nix itself we should just fix it.
  - My guess is that sharding *is* good for the filesystem (and for git's content addressing), and if Nix doesn't like it we should fix Nix to get along with it.
- @growpotkin: Beware of case-insensitive file systems!

## outcomes, todos

- @roberth: Update https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/auto-called-packages/pull/8
  - Update PR title, doesn't shorten paths
  - Update details with file path
  - `pkg-fun.nix`
  - No misleading `default.nix` convention
