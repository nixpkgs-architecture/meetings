### RFC 140

Next steps in the mass migration to `pkgs/by-name`:

### https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/148730

- @KAction: Wondering about standardising package flags
- @infinisil: See also https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/131271
- Also, `config` can also be used for very widely needed flags
- (we had some detailed discussions)
- My recommendation: Write an RFC-like document to describe the desired approach in detail, its alternatives, advantages/disadvantages, etc.
- @KAction: Will do
