## Discussion

- Phases alternatives
  - @j-k: Other build systems have other phases-like mechanisms, apkg build. Generally steps with bash.
  - @infinisil: Main difference with nix is the need for overriding
  - @qyliss: pkgsrc has phases, homebrew doesn't
  - @j-k: t2linux has something nice based on configuration that can switch between cmake/gcc during the build
- @j-k: Gentoo's use flags are related
  - @nbathum: USE flags more similar to features
  - @infinisil: Like enableGUI arguments in Nix
    - @ash: How
    - @infinisil: enableGUI-like arguments very simple interface, other override mechanism more complex
  - @ash: Some packages are configurable with nixpkgs.config, also in NixOS
    - @infinisil: Global flags, only as useful as the packages making use of it
  - @ash: Better expose .override feature flags
  - @robert: Use flags make caches less useful, exponential combinations
    - @qyliss: Closure size for embedded important -> Should have USE/feature flags
  - @nbathum: For embedded, removing not needed firmware can reduce size by a lot for when you only need a specific board
- @infinisil: Renaming module system terms needed?
  - @roberth: From own experience confused. English definitions for declaration/definition similar.
  - @j-k: In docs call, derivation/package confusion was talked about
    - @roberth: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6507
  - @infinisil: Renaming sounds like a good idea
- @infinisil: What should the team focus on?
  - @infinisil: Phases/package builder modurality
  - @j-k: Gripes: Go builder annoying
    - @infinisil: Same thing as phases
  - @qyliss: `rustPLatform.buildRustPackage` should be gotten rid of
  - @npb: Removing `mkDerivation` from nixpkgs, https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/3
    - @npb: Converting stdend.mkDertivation { ‚Ä¶ } to { derviationBuilder = stdenv.mkDerivation; ‚Ä¶ }
      Then all overriding becomes //
      And adding a wrapper to Nixpkgs to make all calls.

  - @ash: Recursive overriding, e.g. `src` version
    - @j-k: Would be fixed by nbp's suggestion
    - @jtojnar: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/119942
    - @infinisil: Should this be used throughout? Doesn't matter because replace `stdenv.mkDerivation` is in scope
  - Get rid of language-specific ones, only mkDerivation?
    - @infinisil: Wouldn't be called mkDerivation, new name, buildDerivation?
    - @john: mkDerivation should be built on the base abstraction. What if cmake and autoconf are both specified? Currently one would override the other. Clean up assumptions
      - @ash: Per-phase hooks
    - @infinisil: Should have some basic expectations, e.g. adding a build input has an effect, would expose cmake + autoconf
  - @Gytis: Do we want to use modules system for derivation builders? Main risk is performance, main merit are composibility and types
    - @john: Hold off for now, does have benefits, but let's go for easier success stories first
    - @Gytis: Recursive data structure is convenient for builders
    - @infinisil: Very good for configuring, but too slow. Could make prototype but it will be too slow
    - @ash: High memory usage
    - @Gytis: Memory usage should not be an issue since as long as we are considering 1 eval loop per derivation builder
    - @ash: Problem that everything needs to be imported, even if not enabled
      - @Gytis: No, there is no need to import any extras. 1 eval loop per derivation builder and we define what goes into the eval loop via `imports`. Example: `pkgs.buildDerivation { imports = [ pkgs.rustBuilder]; }`

## Jitsi Discussion 

(before it was decided to use matrix for chat instead)

- (17:02)
- Robert Hensing says:nixpkgs does use the module system üòÉ
- (17:11)
- qyliss says:I had missed the discussion about renaming definitions and declarations, but what a good idea
- qyliss says:pkgsrc has phases, with exactly the same names as us even
- qyliss says:I've always wondered if that's where Nixpkgs phases came from.
- qyliss says:I don't think Homebrew has phases
- (17:14)
- Robert Hensing says:the need for users to call runHook can largely be removed https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/175605
- (17:15)
- qyliss says:Something I've thought about a lot recently is that it seems pretty dubious that build/install are separate phases. That's the way autoconf/Meson work, sure, but if you're doing custom builds it encourages putting files into a build directory and then copying it straight back out again, for little benefit over writing into $out directly.
- (17:16)
- j-k says: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2_SDE
- (17:17)
- qyliss says:"package source"
- qyliss says:USE flags
- qyliss says:not sure if they're related to phases though
- qyliss says:they're more like our Nixpkgs "config" argument
- qyliss says:or the platform attributes, like gcc.march
- (17:18)
- nbathum says:agree with qyliss on USE flags, more about configuring features
- (17:18)
- Robert Hensing says:the problem with USE flags is that they increase the number of potential configurations exponentially, defeating the binary caching effectiveness and burdening the community with a larger support load
- (17:20)
- qyliss says:Having something like USE flags is really important if we want to compete more in the embedded space
- qyliss says:Nix has a lot of value to offer there over existing solutinos
- qyliss says:People need to be able to disable stuff they don't need to keep image size small, and it's hugely painful to try to do with overlays or overrides.
- (17:23)
- Robert Hensing says:I think we'll want to support such use cases explicitly then; say desktop NixOS vs server NixOS vs embedded NixOS
- (17:25)
- qyliss says:I disagree, embedded use cases vary wildly, and every system has its own set of requirements.
- qyliss says:In practice, we don't have huge support problems with our existing package options.
- (17:26)
- Robert Hensing says:right, but how do we contain the combinatorial explosion then?
- (17:26)
- qyliss says:I think if people are overriding package options, they're responsible for keeping it working.
- qyliss says:At least that's how I've always seen it, as somebody working on a system that uses a bunch of overrides (Spectrum), and that's a tradeoff I'm entirely happy to accept.
- (17:27)
- jtojnar says: üëçjust caching a single default like we do now is a good compromise
- (17:28)
- qyliss says:Agree
- (17:28)
- nbathum says: üëç
- (17:28)
- qyliss says:For more complex use cases, it's not hard to run your own binary cache
- qyliss says:Which we do for Spectrum.
- (17:28)
- ashkitten says: üëç
- (17:28)
- Robert Hensing says:so we keep the status quo then
- (17:29)
- qyliss says:Yes, although an easier way to configure things for _all_ packages would be nice
- qyliss says:And yeah, occasionally there's value in multiple cached versions of a package, e.g. qemu_kvm and qemu (the latter contains support for emulating all architectures, not just the current one, which is HUGE and often not necessary)
- qyliss says:(The current Nixpkgs config mechanism isn't very good for this, so I don't support expanding that even though it would allow more global config)
- qyliss says:Using the module system could be a good way forward, but as usual with the module system I'd be concerned about eval time.
- qyliss says:Oh does that chat not get streamed?
- qyliss says:I thought it did.
- qyliss says:Otherwise we could maybe copy/paste in into meeting notes?
- (17:31)
- Robert Hensing says:the module system isn't slow. NixOS is
- (17:31)
- qyliss says:ah okay
- (17:31)
- Mindavi says:What does 'NixOS is slow' mean?
- (17:32)
- qyliss says: üëè
- qyliss says: üëè
- qyliss says:They're mostly internal names, aren't they?
- qyliss says:It's pretty rare for modules to do option metaprogramming with the "options" attribute
- qyliss says:Which is AFAIK the only place they're exposed programatically
- qyliss says:(But the module system isn't my strong point so maybe I'm wrong!)
- qyliss says:"derivation" is such an overloaded term!
- (17:35)
- Robert Hensing says:attempt to define package https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6507
- (17:37)
- qyliss says:Infinisil: from the Matrix channel: 15:35 <nbp> infinisil: Could this be the back channel for meeting communication? Such that others who are not following live can catch up?
- (17:37)
- nbathum says: üëç
- (17:39)
- qyliss says:I think it's a good but the important thing is that everybody needs to be reading Matrix during the meeting.
- qyliss says:My client doesn't support threads.
- qyliss says:So my replies would end up unthreaded.
- qyliss says:I think
- qyliss says:Anyway, moving over to Matrix
- (17:39)
- Gytis says:@j-k is this what you mean? https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/nix-patterns/blob/master/blueprints/flake.nix#L7-L10
- (17:46)
- j-k says:yeah that kind of thing
- (17:46)
- jtojnar says:that is what Robert‚Äôs https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/119942 is for
- (17:48)
