- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/30
  - no reply yet
- https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/18
  - not a blocker for opening the RFC

### Open the RFC

- Tried to open RFC from https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths by merging histories with the rfcs repository.
  - Failed to open the PR because that repository is not a fork of the rfcs repository
- Let's do a fork of the rfcs repository instead, just pushing the same history though
  - Won't have existing issues and PR's in the new repository though
  - https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/rfcs
- Opened the RFC! https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140
- As for shepherd nominations, should have some from the Nixpkgs Arch team, but not have the entire shepherd team consist of the team
  - @infinisil is proposing himself and @roberth

## Action items

- @infinisil will continue writing [the tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp)
