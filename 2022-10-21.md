# NixCon Meeting
- stdenv
- all-packages.nix

## [Valentin]: do it now, freeze the agenda
- We should pick a single job, prioritize it above all else and get it done using the massed efforts of the team.
- sed trick
- tests and acceptance criteria
    - nix-eval-jobs
    - attrset tree
    - go overriding, symlinks to old things
    - symlink into warning/throw
    - "Nix"-warning symlink
    - old location..... "if you see this call us"
    - can ignore patch files for now
- we can do 80% with quick tooling/hacks, then manual to fix things
  - Tooling doesn't need to be perfect
  - We shouldn't need to need to parse expressions for this migration
  - on the other hand, tooling *does* need to be reusable so can be run on PRs to aid in fixing conflicts
    - otherwise any PRs predating the big re-org will be very annoying to merge

.... recorder left early
