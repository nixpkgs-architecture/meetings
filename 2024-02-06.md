## Agenda

### Nixpkgs Architecture Team future

- @infinisil: Proposal:
  - Archive https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture
  - Remove https://nixos.org/community/teams/nixpkgs-architecture.html
  - Migrate issues from https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues to Nixpkgs repo
  - Create "architecture" label
  - Create @NixOS/nixpkgs-architecture
  - Archive private channel and make public
  - Remove the meeting for now
  - Regular meeting every 2 weeks with interested parties

- @infinisil: The team aspect isn't working out
  - No resources
  - No responsibilites and no authority
    - @tomberek: How can we address that?
    - @infinisil: Really on an individual level
    - @infinisil: Should be improved more generally, a solution for ownership is needed
    - @tomberek: Drawing parallels to the Nix team, got a lot of little things done, builds trust
    - @tomberek: If you have one big thing, it's a hard thing to catch back up on it if you miss the start
    - @infinisil: If you do small things it's hard to get bigger things done though
    - @roberth: Nix team has succeeded in breaking things down, e.g. fetchTree stabilization as a prerequisite to Flakes stabilization
    - @tomberek: Maybe worth another shot
    - @tomberek: Working group for a specific task vs a discussion ground for various issues
    - @infinisil: Discussion forum could be the "architecture" label
    - @tomberek: Proposal:
      - First finalise `pkgs/by-name`
      - After that, have a period of getting more contributors, work on smaller things, more splitting of work
      - Authority aspect: Nixpkgs needs something like an architecture team
    - @infinisil: Nixpkgs contributions often have poor quality
    - @roberth: Most people just need to get their stuff done, not as an "engineer"
    - @tomberek: Some people need guidance to learn
  - @infinisil: Maybe the balance needs to be improved, a bit more reviewing
    - Maybe RFC mentoring regularly with authors for 1 weekly meeting for a month, get the general direction of the RFC right
    - Blog post/tutorial on authoring RFCs?
  - @tomberek: Primary goal of improving contributing experience in Nixpkgs and get more contributors
    - Did it work?
      - @infinisil: Looks like it
    - How to continue the goal?
      - @infinisil: Very abstract, we already have more concrete things to work on. Can use "architecture" label to track these
      - Probably don't need more exploratory work
  - @infinisil:Big efforts, probably no volunteers would want that
  - Maybe call for sponsors or sponsored people
    - preferably an opencollective?
    - otherwise sponsor an existing contributor
    - otherise sponsor employee time
  - @tomberek: There's bigger companies relying on Nix now, should expect them to sponsor maintenance/architecture work
    - @infinisil: Could spend some time on that after `pkgs/by-name`
  - @infinisil: Currently need to wait for reviews for things I do, would be great to have a person that reviews my work

- @infinisil: For now writing out the top proposal, doesn't conflict with the above discussion
- @infinisil: In the future: RFC for delegating Nixpkgs code owners with authority and responsibility

## Misc
- Module system builtin for Nix? (discussed last time??)
- @Ericson2314: Interesting gcc work going on in https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/132343, might be able to get rid of targetPlatform
- Package modules / [Bring all packaging layers into a single fixpoint](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/273815)
