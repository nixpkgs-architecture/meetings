## Notes

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22 We have a simple tool with rnix!

Doesn't quite work with paths with expansions yet, but that's OK.
 - @growpotkin and @Ericson2314: Agreed.

Other than that, just going over our backlog

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/18

  - @Ericson2314: let's talk to e.g. Cargo people, not just stumble around in the dark over what we need to measure.

  - We look at https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index to see wht they do
  
  - Go on the Rust Zulip to find channel to ask them asyncronously.

  - Let's also see if the people from https://github.com/triton/triton have any insights, they also do sharding

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/9

  - Most things won't be moved in MVP, and so we can not worry about them.

  - The few cases that might be can be handled manually.

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/5

Not much to do, can mention in RFC.

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/2

Close, not our responsiblity to avoid breakages.

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/1

Will depend on perf analysis (#17) but lean towards.

### Action items

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinsil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.

- @growpotkin will give https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/7314 a try with @Ericson2314 assisting.
