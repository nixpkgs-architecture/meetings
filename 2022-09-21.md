## Administration

- Shorten meetings to 30 minutes?
  - @cab: Report meetings short, longer for discussions
    - @mkaito: sync calls short, more work groups
  - @mkaito: Depends on how much there is to discuss, don't mind long discussions
  - @cab: Longer meetings gives more opportunity for people to join. Length of sync meetings should depend on what there is tell
    - @infinisil: Minimum fixed amount, but possible to block out more
      - @cab: Maximum fixed amount
      - @infinisil: Both minimum amount of time to reach the team at a specific point, maximum to not go over time
    - @mkaito: Other meetings for specific discussions
    - @infinisil: Minimum 30 minutes, max hour
  - @mkaito: Talk about handling agenda, want it to be more public. Are people interested in joining, discuss the agenda before/between meetings
    - @infinisil: Agenda is what happened last week for now. How about listing the things a day before the meeting
      - @mkaito: +1
    - @nbp: Variable meeting length -> Fixed agenda
    - @infinisil: Keep recording going until the end, but after agenda is discussed, wish a good day
  - @mkaito: Put agenda on discourse for more engagement
    - @infinisil: Reminder for the meeting
- @cab: Mob sessions for writing RFCs
  - @mkaito: Feel free to. Summary would be nice

- @infinisil: RFC drafts as repository, use issues
  - @cab: Kind of like google docs
    - @mkaito: Not very accessible
    - @cab: Google docs has proper formatting, can comment on paragraphs
    - @infinisil: Start with empty repo, make initial draft as PR, can be reviewed
    - @mkaito: Final deliverable is an RFC, very straightforward
  - @mkaito: Mention in-progress draft RFCs
  - @tomberek: +1
  - @John: sounds good
  - @mkaito: Tracking of active drafts, project boards, looking into that

## Standup

- @tomberek: Looking at auto-called-packages, intent to test with lazy-trees
- @infinisil
  - Tested auto-called-package tree with bash, rg, sed, lot of file updates, might need a tool for that
  - @John: Maybe worth hacking it for now, is there something existing like that?
    - @infinisil: rnix-parser would be used
    - @John: Maybe worth writing the tool then
    - @cab: Tvix might be worth looking into, rnix-parser fork might have some useful changes

## Notes

- @john: Look at related work, triton, <https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/auto-called-packages/issues/5>
- @infinisil: The auto-called-packages RFC will move all trivial `callPackage` calls to be auto-called. This leaves `all-packages.nix` with some patterns that could be addressed by other RFCs. E.g. the version override pattern like `python = python3` could be addressed with a separate issue about reorganizing version handling in nixpkgs
  - @john: Sounds good, removing all trivial ones brings focus to more complicated ones, pick lowest hanging fruits repeatedly
- @infinisil: Announce when I work on things, others can join in when they want, mob session
