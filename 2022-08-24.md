## Agenda

- @DavHau: Upgrade path for nixpkgs? Small incremental changes or reinvent first, then compatibility?
  - @DavHau: Lot of discussions about big changes, but then lots of worries about going too fast, there's easier/smaller changes. Decision for which problems this team should tackle?
  - @infinisil: Big effort or big decisions should require the team
    - @mkaito: Agreed, focus on bigger issues, smaller issues to test and develop processes of the team. E.g. having a separate developer process before making changes to nixpkgs. Get the process out of the way so it's not a problem for later bigger issues
  - @infinisil: Compatibility question?
    - @mkaito: Transition path is needed. We can't really rip the bandaid
    - @infinisil: Balance between transitioning and a clean solution
- @infinisil: Issue board at https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2/views/2
  - https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2 in scope?
    - @john: Hard to know what an actionable solution looks like
    - @alex: Has been my focus recently.
    - @David: Connected to https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/3. If we replace it with module system, override problems go away
    - @john: How to compose things and whether things are split up. Consists of bash script and mkDerivation itself. Overrides are bad, but anything you can change without mass rebuild is healthier to change. Splitting things up in general makes it easier down the road
  - @cab: ABI compatibility in scope? E.g. depending on the ABI of openssl itself
    - @Alex: More flexibility for CA to integrate with ABI compatibility
      - @john: Can't use CA in hydra yet
    - @infinisil: Ties into https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2
    - @cab: provides and requires attributes on packages would be nice. Allows replacing a lot of package names with provides, more automatic dependencies.
      - @David: Fundamental problem with Nix vs language builders. Packages declare a version range that's supported, notion of which versions are supported, version resolvers. Interesting problem
      - @Alex: Implemented [npm-semver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semver) parser in Nix for nodejs. Ranges are messy, sometimes you need them, but try avoiding them, since it involves a SAT solver
        - @cab: Solvable by running SAT in IFD, but Nix currently doesn't support IFD very well, not parallel
      - @john: Can have some stupid solving and version annotations, e.g. no backtracking, multiple choices -> pick any, have asserts, some manual resolution, use metadata. Draft RFC relates to this.
        - @tomberek: What is the convention of outputs, more organizational question, have a standard way.
      - @cab: How to start with something actionable?
        - @infinisil: Write down problem
      - @j-k: https://github.com/nixos/rfcs/pull/107. Nixpkgs issue about making all package names lowercase https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/188001
    - @cab: Multilayer builds for nixpkgs. Replace phases with actual separate stages, different derivations. overlayfs
      - @infinisil: Was discussed previously, generally thought of as a good idea
      - @DavHau: Agreed
  - @infinisil: Should https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2/views/2 be in scope
    - @j-k: Lots of individual improvements which would be very useful. E.g. licenses, currently no way to specify boolean operations for licenses. Would like better vulnerability tracking. Mark patched, naming conventions for patches, linking to CVs, separate data on website?
  - @infinisil: https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2 in scope?
    - Yes
  - @infinisil: https://github.com/orgs/nixpkgs-architecture/projects/2 in scope?
    - @mkaito: Not in scope. Big issues, overwhelmingly social, man power issue. Some automation effort was done, not very successful. Close issues we don't care about.
      - @David: Merge train idea
      - @j-k: Agreed, count of issues shouldn't be a focus of the team. Some other issues could reduce this. E.g. bors for merging with maintainer-can-merge rules, or e.g. two required
   - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/148730 in scope?
     - @David: Related to other issues. Package configuration interface. Some kind of module system that's discoverable would fix this. More generally named issue for package configuration interface could group these changes.
     - @Alex: There's `config`, and overrides can be controlled by 
     - @David: Smaller issue, bigger improvements would solve this among others.
