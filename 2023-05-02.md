## Notes

### RFC 140 ( Auto `callPackage` Thing )

- Review changes
  - Relax requirement on references to files across
    "unit directory boundary".
    - Allows _legacy_, e.g. non-unit directory expressions, to refer to files
      inside of unit directories.
    - Expressions inside of unit-directories are still unable to refer to files
      outside of their sub-tree.
    - Maps well to flake restrictions.
    - Simplifies CI/CD change detection.
  - Handling custom arguments.
    - Reverting recommendation about disallowing arguments to `callPackage`.
    - Intent was to improve readability, by making custom arguments live near
      the expressions/recipes they apply to ( as opposed to `all-packages.nix` ).
    - This may be a future requirement and there is still support for the "spirit"
      of the recommendation.
  - Split tasks into two phases.
    - Phase 1: establish unit directory standard
    - Phase 2: migration of existing packages
- Schedule shepherd meeting
  - @infinisil: Will schedule

### @growpotkin: Check for name collisions
Because directory names will map to package names, we must ensure that
we do not have any collisions on lower-case form package names.

This requirement is a result of case insensitive filesystems.

Example:
"foo" and "FoO" would collide on the path: `unit/fo/foo/`.


### Packages Modules Working Group

- Had a first successful meeting
- Meeting notes: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules/blob/main/meetings/2023-04-28.md
- Created list of use cases/problems, and assigned documenting them to members

## Action items

- @growpotkin: Check to see if any existing package names will collide.
- @infinisil: Update RFC 140 text, schedule shepherd meeting
- document Team + Working groups change
- @infinisil will continue writing [the tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp)
