## Notes

### Shepherds for [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)
- @roberth as a potential shepherd, but time contraints, pass for now in favor of external participation?
  - @infinisil: robert would be the most appropriate
  - @roberth: Yes I'm gonna do it

### Clean attributes
- https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/pull/217243
- Seperately expose the derivation arguments and the "internals"

### Module system for packages
- Work group assembly? (cc @roberth)
  - @growpotkin: I'm in
  - @infinisil: I'm in
  - Let's invite @DavHau
  - Let's ask @nbp, relevant is https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/3
  - SOS, flake-parts, POP, simple-modules, blueprints, callPackage, ad-hoc, floco

Update: @infinisil and @growpotkin and some others paired after the meeting to write down a problem description and discourse announcement in https://pad.lassul.us/lr4EhSckTJSByDLBLcm_-w

## Vendored Rust Cargo.locks:
- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217084 
- FODs being replaced by more fine-grained FODs
- generally we want to avoid computation
- large increase in distributed Nixpkgs tarball size.
  - increase of 32.6 MiB
  - Nixpkgs repo size
    - git history and other junk ( distributed tarball size ) ~90 MiB ( @tomberek )
    - Working tree ( shallow clone ) ~280 MiB ( @roberth )
- similar to "two-phase" nixpkgs? RFC: https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/109
- recommendation: Only update the cargoSha256 hashes for now, size increase is too much, should be thought about more.

### Should we have a time in the meeting for smaller issues

- @infinisil: Let's have a 10/15 minute in the beginning?
- team should bring up issues and PRs as appropriate
- @roberth: Have a separate meeting to discuss issues/PR's from project groups
  - @infinisil: I'd have time for another meeting
  - @tomberek: It's good to have a dedicated work time
- @roberth: One distracted meeting for smaller issues and monitoring the projects (including RFC 140 and the modules for packages)
  - Separate longer work meetings for each of the projects

## Action items

- @roberth: Nominate as RFC 140 shepherd

- @infinisil: Schedule meeting for RFC 140 tooling work

- @infinisil and @growpotkin pairing for writing issue description and work group assembly discourse post

- @infinisil will continue writing [the tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp)
