## Notes

### [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)

Checking for package collisions:
```
$ nix repl -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tarball/master
Added 19084 variables.
nix-repl> lib.foldl' (acc: el: if lib.toLower acc == lib.toLower el then builtins.trace "${acc} <-> ${el}" el else el) "" (lib.attrNames pkgs)
trace: antimicroX <-> antimicrox
trace: flameGraph <-> flamegraph
trace: vkBasalt <-> vkbasalt
```

But these are all aliases of each other, so no problem

- Steering committee status unclear, so went ahead and had the first meeting with nominated shepherds.

- Made changes before and after the meeting to address concerns and clean it up

- Tested backporting, works without problems

### [Packages modules WG](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules)

- Regular meetings happening!

- A few pull requests open

- meeting notes in `pkgs-modules` repos.

### Misc: super pure bootstrap from GUIX

- https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/the-full-source-bootstrap-building-from-source-all-the-way-down/

- Emily Trau got started on doing this for Nix. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/227914 --- first PR, and follows ups also linked there.

- Great foundation for Nixpkgs Architecture experimentation because it is entirely self contained

- binary blogs, coarse-grained things like `stdenv` make more more mass rebuilds / friction / ineritia.

- @roberth also mentioned, good place for not exposing all attributes, see also [nixpkgs cleanAttrs PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217243)

- No need for action, but should keep an eye on it, potential stdenv rewrite using it as a base

- `derivationWithMeta` for the win! It is good to separate the meta checking infra from the rest of `stdenv.mkDerivation`
