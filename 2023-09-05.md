## Agenda

- New members @DavHau and @phaer
  - Both joined after we dissolved the pkgs-modules working group
  - member ist on the website got updated
- Meeting got re-scheduled.
  It's now every 4th Tuesday at 13h UTC (15h CEST)
- Administration: Don't record anymore?
  - Livestream working again, so you ca watch this on YouTube. 
  - There's discussion whether it's worth the effort and the change that ppl might be more hesitant to speak if it's recorded
  - We could continue to record presentations while stopping to do so for open discussions
  - Argument: Need for recorded discussion might hint at lacking meeting notes
  - Decision: This will be the last recorded meeting, we'll depend on meeting notes alone from here on.
  - Exceptions will probably be made for presentations. 
  - Task: We need to update the NAT README on Github. @DavHau volunteers to do it.
- Anything to prepare before Nixcon?
 - https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/ is a bit outdated.
 - NixCon will be a good opportunity to get new people interested in the WG so it would be nice to ensure the docs are up to date.
 - The normative part, "hard facts" seem to be mostly up to date, it's mostly the description of the work we do and our process which could do with a make-over
- [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)
  - After the NAT meeting will be the final review and ideally merge of https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/237439
  - @Infinisil re-worked https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md and some of the linked READMEs in in i.e. `lib/` and `lib/path`
  - It now features a "Conventions" section, for branch conventions as well as code convention 
  - After https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/250885 has been merged in our last meeting, we are going to merge https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/237439 today; so people can start using it on and around NixCon.
  - The automated migration of packages to the new `by-name` scheme will be merged at a later date: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/211832
  - 
- Anything else?
