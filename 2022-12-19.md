## Notes

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/20#discussion_r1049042506

- @roberth: More declarative, describe the end goal
  - avoid discussing implementation details of tooling, and focus on API/structure.
  - "The unit directory contains a set of self-contained pieces of Nix code that don't reference any files outside their own subtree":

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/20#discussion_r1051188387
- Can/should we modify `nix edit` to stop relying on `meta.position`?
- @roberth: Can see it working
- Don't mention it for now, it could derail the conversation
- @growpotkin: "Your scientists were so busy asking if they could..."

### https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/20#discussion_r1051193846
- @infinisil: Should we link back to the NAT issues, etc in RFCs?
- @tomberek: Some amount of linking is okay
- @infinisil: Link to https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths at the top of the RFC
- @roberth: RFC should be self-contained, should be discussed in the RFC PR
- @infinisil: Archive the original repo?
- @growpotkin, @roberth: Single source of truth, should improve the RFC if it doesn't contain everything needed
- @infinisil: The other way around: Link from original repo to RFC PR and archive

### How to formally have the draft approved by every member?
- @roberth: Everybody goes over it, makes PR's to improve it, accept in the meeting
- @growpotkin: make a "pre-release" branch and review as a merge?
  - @roberth: Probably not needed
- @infinisil: Have 0 open issues and PRs

### https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/7447
- @tomberek: Is this needed? If yes we might need to wait until we can rely on a Nix version with that change
- @growpotkin: It's only an optimization, not concerned

### A way to directly traverse into the shard

@tomberek: Like `pkgs.sharded.open.openoffice`
- @growpotkin: Aliasing problems, syncing one attribute with another, particularly with overrides, e.g. should `pkgs.sharded.*` or `pkgs.*` be overridden, does it apply to the other?
- @infinisil: Can be done later, if at all needed
- @infinisil: `pkgs.hello.unitDirectory`, a bit like `pkgs.hello.meta.position`
- @roberth: (Relative paths?)

## Action items

- everbody: Go through the entire RFC draft in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths and make a PR for anything that needs changing

- @Ericson2314 and @growpotkin will continue with https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/7447, especially testing it on Darwin

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinisil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.
  - Ask git too, maybe. They do for `.git/objects`.
    - @growpotkin: I'd be shocked if GitHub knew implementation details of `git` objects.
