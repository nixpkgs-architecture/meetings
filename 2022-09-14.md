## Agenda

- Discussing https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/auto-called-packages
    - Sharding: Poll, performance measurements
    - What to do about other definitions
    - @tomberek: What about package sets? How does it interact with sharding?
        - @infinisil: 
    - @infinisil: Don't focus on special cases
    - @tomberek: What about lazy trees Nix branch?
        - @infinisil: Nix should be made to work well with nixpkgs
        - @tomberek: Just for performance measurements, to make sure no big regressions
    - @layus: Is auto needed?
        - @infinisil: Could be removed in the future once everything is auto-called
        - @tomberek: Could use double underscore for "hidden" bits, `pkgs/__auto`
        - @infinisil: Generally dir names aren't considered API surface of nixpkgs
        - @tomberek: For sharding, could allow rebalancing in the future. E.g. `pkgs/__prefix` could be for sharding if it becomes necessary. Also top of the sort order
    - @infinisil: For future, arbitrary expressions, not limited to `callPackage`
    - @tomberek: Library function in nixpkgs so it's exposed and can be reused by third-parties, lots of people reinventing the same function
        - @layus: Kind of happens for overlays already (folder with default.nix's), support could be moved to Nix itself for performance reasons
            - @infinisil: Probably not for `callPackage`
            - @layus: Just mapping a folder into an attribute set. intermediate list of attributes might be slow when done in Nix, would be better in C++ Nix source
            - @infinisil: `builtins.unsafeGetAttrPos` should be made to work with `builtins.readDir`
