## Notes

### [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)

- Went into FCP again and should be merged soon by the RFC steering committee
- Implementation: mostly discussion since last meeting

### [Packages Modules WG](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules)

- No updates from @infinisil who is just back from time off
- @DavHau lead the meetings in recent weeks instead, see the repository for updates

### What to do with this team

- @roberth failed to host the meeting and apologizes
  - @growpotkin: * and Alex were present and found some things to discuss.
- @infinisil: team is responsible for managing working groups, and it doesn't make a lot of sense to only have updates in these meetings
- Ideas for how to proceed with this team
  - Schedule longer review meetings when needed
    - E.g. when someone has an idea that would need a working group, or if a working group would like their RFC draft reviewed
    - Decision: Do this, but still have regular sync meetings monthly at least
  - Leadership rotation
    - Everything can be delegated including stream setup
    - No decision to do this for now
  - @growpotkin: In general, need stuff to do
    - Addressing Nixpkgs issues (e.g. label: significant)
      - Weird because we don't have authority
      - review is still useful
    - @growpotkin: Maintenance tasks?
       - @infinisil: Better to focus on fundamental / long standing issues
  - Specific things to work on/start a working group for:
    - Existing issues in the [team issues](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues)
    - @growpotkin: version numbers in attributes
    - @infinisil: version resolution
    - @Ericson2314: Nixpkgs CLI (but don't have time to lead it)
       - @infinisil: announce and ask someone to lead? A discourse post can be enough to find a group. Might need some time, e.g. a couple of months, but that's ok.
       - Coordinating a new WG in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/20
         - Use the [packages modules discourse post](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/working-group-member-search-module-system-for-packages/26574) as an example
  - Dissolve the team as a possibility
- Mini "retrospective":
   - We got things done
   - RFCs are inherently slow
   - How do we motivate people to do this kind of work?
      - It's hard to get people to join a specific task sometimes
      - RFC-like process is not fun for everyone
      - Some people may want to join when they see RFC 140

## Action

- Everyone subscribe to the [Nixpkgs Architecture topic](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/dev/nixpkgs/44) on discourse
- infinisil: Schedule the meeting to be monthly -> Done, every 4 weeks
