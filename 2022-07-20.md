## Discussions

### [Legacy stdenv.mkDerivation](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/3)

- @yorik: Rename stdenv to cStdenv?
  - @infinisil: stdenv is used for bootstrapping the whole system starting with C
- @Gytis: No namespace for stdenv.mkDerivation, or builders.mkDerivation, makeBuilder, etc. more descriptive 
- @infinisil: buildDerivation? Maybe overloaded. But name not very important
- @Gytis: Who can do it beside John Ericson, cross comp and co.
          Do we want to use bash?
- @infinisil: Separate issue replacing bash?
  - @Gytis: Ruby?
        Examples: https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/nix-reinventing-the-wheel/blob/master/builders/scripts/phases.rb
  - @infinisil: Too ugly maybe?
  - @Gytis: Backticks can be used for spawning commands
  - @yorik: WASM/WASI https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/6697
        Could be used for replacing builders in general
    - @Gytis: Still need a language to generate WASM from
    - @yorik: Use Nix to generate WASM
    - @infinisil: Would go into using Nix as a runtime language
  - @Gytis: Requirements:
    - easy to script
    - easy to bootstrap
    - passing structured data (JSON)
  - @ash: Should be concerned about portability
  - @robert: Needs to work with bootstrapping
  - @infinisil/@kevincox: Better interface between Nix and builder language, structuredAttrs
  - @Gytis: typescript actually is pretty good, etc.
  - @robert: Maybe separate from stdenv.mkDerivation improvements
    - @infinisil: Interlinked? And good to experiment
  - @Gytis: Lua, Janet (lispy)
  - @ash: Lua is good for metaprogramming. (Ruby also!)
  - @Gytis: No shell convenience
  - @infinisil: Can we have multiple languages supported
    - @kevincox Should be opinionated
    - @robert: Makes composability hard
  - @infinisil: Is Bash really that bad that we need to change?
  - @kevincox: Bash is bad enough
  - @ash: Lua has posix libraries, shell not needed as much
  - @infinisil: Slowness issues in the past with bash
  - @mkaito: Shell replacing but shelling out?
    - @kevin: Shelling -> forking separate processes
    - @mkaito: But Ruby calls shell with ``
    - @kevin: Should avoid that
  - @infinisil: Be able to pass Nix functions to the builder script
    - @robert: That would be using Nix for imperative stuff
    - @robert: Wrote a runtime for Nix in the past, was hard without types
    - @infinisil: Also wrote [something](https://github.com/Infinisil/nix-rts) similar
  - @infinisil: Create a separate issue to track default builder language replacement
  - @Gytis : One may build ruby without any extra dependencies. Also mruby is a super mimimal version of ruby runtime. Both are easy to bootstrap 
  - @yorik: Ruby/Lua by default isn't great, they need libraries
    - @Gytis: Ruby doesn't need libraries, a lot of power by default
  - @infinisil: Oil shell, RFC
  - @Gytis: Searching for languages? https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs#fsharp
    - @ash: WASM is not as portable
  - @ash: mruby requires ruby to build, uses rake
  - @mkaito: Python?
    - @Gytis: Bad for bootstrapping
  - @mkaito: Define Lua packages in Nix, DSL?
  - @yorik: Embed Lua/WASM into Nix itself
    - -> Nix needs to know how to do everything
    - Supporting all systems, how to package Lua, etc.
  - @Gytis: Postpone by a couple of years -> Rust in GCC!
  - @infinisil: ABI for builder utilities
  - @yorik: Abstract code to run on any system, more system-agnostic derivations

- @infinisil:
  - derivation = arguments: { derivation = ...; } // arguments;
  - derivationStrict = arguments: { out = derivation ...; }
