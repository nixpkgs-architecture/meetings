## Notes

### RFC 140 shepherds

- @infinisil: @wanja do you want to?
- @wanja: Is it OK that to be a shepherd since I worked on the implementation (but not RFC)?
- @infinisil: Interesting question, no clear answer.
- @wanja: Will think about it

### Should meetings be recorded?

- @Ericson2314: Meh about it
- @roberth: Is okay with it, doesn't feel it's inhibited 
- @Wanja: Asking the wrong people, should ask matrix
- @infinisil: If we want to stop recording, we should have better meeting notes
- @figsoda (Matrix): Maybe delete the recording after a week?
  - @infinisil: Once out there, it's out there forever
- @wanja: Record it, but not online, have someone offline do meeting notes, but a lot of work
- @infinisil: Maybe tooling to add transcript automatically
- @infinisil: Could ask on discourse or even ask the foundation for somebody who can transcribe meetings
- @infinisil: Let's keep recording until we figure out meeting notes
