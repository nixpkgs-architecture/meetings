## Agenda/Notes

### [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140)

- Currently blocked on [contributing section pr](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/245243)

### [Packages Modules WG](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules)

- Conclusion: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/pkgs-modules#conclusion
    - Merging with the NAT, review new member applications
        - @phaer and @DavHau from the WG applied
        - Will review asynchronously
            - @infinisil will open a private Matrix to discuss applications
    - @DavHau will work on a poc of using drv-parts to Nixpkgs
    - @phaer: not dissatisfied with the wg
    - @infinisil: would like to center the work around the [team issue tracker](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues)
    - @infinisil: will update the team workflow documentation (github org readme)
- @tomberek wrote https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/21
    - leave a comment if you're interested
- @DavHau did a dream2nix performance benchmark: https://github.com/nix-community/dream2nix/tree/main/misc/benchmarks
    - More test cases would be good
    - Optionally importing modules could improve it - minimizing the number of options to the actually *used* options (no cmake etc)
    - Let's track this in an issue: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues/issues/22
    - @roberth's more minimal module system PoC: https://gist.github.com/roberth/940dff88ca5f5f95949dc309dbe60a65
        - Wrote it to prove a point that a module system isn't too hard and can be faster
        - @phaer: Interested in improvements to more minimal imports
        - See https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/22 and its linked issues
        - @infinisil: Could be an option to have some declaration of which modules depend on which others, and check that using CI
        - @roberth and @phaer might sync on this
        - @infinisil: Even if you don't have time to work on it, writing down what should be done is already great, please use issues in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/issues

### Nixpkgs CLI working group search: https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-cli-working-group-member-search/30517

- 3 people are interested.
- Let's leave it up to the people in the thread to start it

### `pkg.drvPath` string context / DrvDeep

Inquiry by @roberth. Nix team proposes to change the semantics of `.drvPath` not in Nix but in Nixpkgs. Nix team believes it is a strange behavior and should be changed as far as users are concerned.

Current semantics:
 - String context of `drvPath` contains the `.drv` file *and* referenced `.drv` files transitively *and* the outputs *and* the outputs of *all build dependencies transitively*.
Proposed semantics:
 - String context of `drvPath` contains the `.drv` file and referenced `.drv` files transitively.

We can not change this in Nix `builtins.derivation{,Strict}` because that would break old expressions.
Hence the proposal to use the Nixpkgs pin to make the change.

Proposed change in Nixpkgs:
 - Change `mkDerivation` to apply `builtins.unsafeDiscardOutputDependency`, which is not unsafe but applies exactly the proposed change in semantics.
    - For input-addressed derivations it is *possible* to extract output paths without context, but we believe this does not defy anyone's expectations.
 - Check usages of `.drvPath` in Nixpkgs itself

Impact mitigations:
 - Allow users to revert their pin of Nixpkgs while they track down the effect of the change. (`grep -F .drvPath`, `nix-diff`?)
    - We expect most usages to be in "advanced functions" which we expect to be comparatively rare outside nixpkgs.
 - Add [`builtins.addDrvOutputDependencies`](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/8595) to recover the old semantics where users need it.

#### Discussion

 - @infinisil: This could break user tooling, and it won't emit a warning
 - @infinisil: If they reference a .drv they probably would've already stripped the output deps anyway
 - @infinisil: How about `drvPath2`? For the migration
   - Deprecate `drvPath` and refer users to new attr
 - @roberth `drvFile`?
 - @infinisil: `nix-build`, `nix repl` use `drvPath` though, so it's hard to deprecate
 - @roberth: Can deprecate `drvPath` when Nix relies on `outputs` etc only
 - @infinisil: That's the proper way to make this change
 - @infinisil: `drvPath` is a Nix feature, used by Nix, changing the behavior in Nixpkgs has the same effects as changing it in Nix itself, needs to be properly deprecated in Nix itself
 - Relates to https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/137
   - @roberth: but not a prerequisite
