## Agenda

- @infinisil: Auto-called package listing
  - @ash: Many PR's blocked from merging due to all-packages.nix merge conflicts
  - @infinisil: Any opposition?
  - @ash: Performance concerns, GitHub file count limit
    - @j-k: all-packages.nix display limit
  - @infinisil: hello lives in pkgs/he/hello, good?
    - @ash: Looks fine. adisbladis experimented with basic flattening, performance improved by two times, not sure if that's nested or not.
  - @infinisil: Lots of `lib`'s -> not limited to prefix of two, could be arbitrary
    - @ash: Prefix for lib -> where does libreoffice go? Edge cases
    - @robert: Not use prefix at all, simple, use file search feature
    - @j-k: Re lib, was some discussion in matrix. Problem with one folder and find feature -> can't scroll.
    - @ash: Never manually gone to file on github, too difficult to find.
      - @infinisil: I use it sometimes
    - @j-k: Change depth where packages live -> need to fix relative references. Unrelated: Mixture between update scripts doing ./., or where the script lives.
    - @ash: Mix of update scripts, direct update or create file in /tmp
  - @ash: Other issue: Rearchitecting renders every PR conflicting, choose branch-off point, work with people doing formatting
  - @robert: Can be a gradual change,
  - @infinisil: Enforce new and updated packages to use new structure
  - @ash: Not a lot of bandwidth
  - @infinisil: If we can automate it, do it
  - @ash: Work with formatting, similar changes. Bring up in RFC 101
  - @ash: What do we do about package sets?
    - @infinisil: Don't touch it
      - @alex: Agreed
  - @infinisil: Allow files, e.g. pkgs/hello.nix?
    - @ash: No need to, more inconsistent
    - @j-k: Maybe very simple initially, but when you need another file lots of changes
  - @ash: How to deal with arguments? all-packages.nix only with overlays for packages that need it
    - @alex: That's what I did
    - @infinisil: Get rid of them when possible
    - @alex: setFunctionArgs in callPackage, leave it in function state before evaluating
    - @infinisil: overrides.nix file with e.g. `hello = { glibc = null; }`
- @infinisil: @alex, take the stage
  - @alex: Took a lot of node packages at work and made them work better. There's a lot of conflicting package versions in node, contrary to nixpkgs (which I think is better). How to manage and refer to multiple versions. Tried `groupBy` with name and version, nested -> overlays complicated. Another attempt adding `/` between name and version, as a reserved character, `"${pname}/${version}"`, latest version is `latest`. Another attempt: using two `-` to separate. In nixpkgs at least consistent suffixes would be great, various ways of doing things. In nixpkgs there's more control over package names. Tricky: If a user wants to define an override for e.g. 8 versions, it's hard to specify override for all versions.
    - @ash: I like the `/` idea
      - @alex: At first not a fan of it because it needs quoting in shell.
      - @ash: I can see it working well with auto-calling packages
      - @alex: To pin a package just add version specifier at the end.w
      - @alex: Easy to split by `/`
      - @infinisil: With auto-calling, `/` would correspond to a subdirectory
      - @ash: Needs good discovery, not any random file should be called
  - @infinisil: Feature sets, select major version only, `pkgs.hello.version "with-gui"`
    - @alex: Thought about this, had to deal with it. Had to deal with sem ver conditionals. If you really need a specific version an assert is great.
  - @ash: Multi-version packages could become a nixpkgs primitive, providing additional attrs providing consistency. Extend to multiple flavours of packages, `ffmpeg`, `ffmpeg_full`. Could be `ffmpeg.version.full`
    - @alex: Context in nixpkgs?
    - @infinisil: 
    - @ash: wine inconsistencies in aliasing
    - @alex: Aliasing at the end, just for being able to reference them. Easily creates duplicates with multiple id
    - @infinisil: Aliases should be disallowed from overriding in nixpkgs? Somewhat doesn't work
  - @ash: Common pattern in multi-version packages: `common.nix` called multiple times internally by specific versions. Problem: `common.nix` is often not exposed, can't modify parts of it. If we invert it, `common.nix` having passthru, overrides could affect `common.nix` and all the versions it specifies.
    - @infinisil: Passthru with a builder for the package.
    - @alex: Baseline, but always swap out source
    - @infinisil: Relates to package builders and phases
  - @infinisil: @alex: `groupBy` can work? Needs overriding improvement
    - @alex: Can work. Would be cleaner for top-level organization. Have a type for package sets.
      - @infinisil: recurseIntoAttrs is similar
    - @alex: Aliases should be kept out of the mix. Mapping function over package set needs to not use all entries, e.g. aliases not


## Jitsi Chat

- @robert: https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#sec-package-naming
- @jtojnar: How to deal with overriden instances, e.g. `webkitgtk_4_1 = webkitgtk.override {libsoup = libsoup_3; };`
- @alex: Example
```
pkgs = {
  foo = pkgs."foo/3.0.0";
  "foo/1.0.0" = ...;
  "foo/2.0.0" = ...;
  "foo/3.0.0" = ...;
} in pkgs
```
- @jtojnar: Is is possible to inject those though? quotes do not seem to work `({ "foo/1.0" }: …) { "foo/1.0" = …; }`
