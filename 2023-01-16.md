## Notes

- After the last meeting @infinisil and @roberth discussed https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/27 and https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/28, rough notes: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/meetings/blob/master/2023-01-09-post.md
 - @Ericson2314: structure vs portion of package hanled trade-off.

Originally we just wanted:
```nix
# pkg-fun.nix
{ stdenv }: stdenv.mkDerivation { .. }
```

But because then adding callPackage overrides would cause people to have to move back to `all-packages.nix`, something like
```nix
# args.nix
pkgs: { stdenv = pkgs.stdenv_noCC; }
```

would be good. But then @roberth is proposal to just generalize it fully like this:

```nix
# pkgs-attr.nix
pkgs: callPackage ./pkg-fun.nix { stdenv = pkgs.stdenv_noCC; }
```

Or even
```
# default.nix:
{ pkgs ? import ../.. {} }: pkgs.callPackage ./pkg-fun.nix { stdenv = pkgs.stdenv_noCC; }
```
- @infinisil: Not isolated
- @growpotkin: That's the use case
- @roberth: Allows later innovation with how packages are created, e.g. modular packages. Don't like having to scan 5 files to determine what should happen, hard to contribute
- @Ericson2314: Do we need any of these files?
- @roberth: Well the `default.nix` allows for experimentation without changing the schema.
- @infinsil: Well what about enforcing the structure?
   - It could in principle handle a lot of things that we want to put things out of scope.
- @Ericson2314: Not always easy to conform to structure, but when you do there's predictability. Fine as a preliminary pattern, we want better dependency specifications (e.g. splicing)
- @tomberek: Invariant to expect from consumers?
  - @roberth: Only use case is through readDir, directory structure isn't a public interface
- @infinisil: Ideal end state: Every file in a unit directory is a standard
  - @Ericson2314: What about internal/private files?
    - @infinisil: Standard location for private files
- @tomberek: Interactions are hard, just readDir and callPackage is simple, maybe not as generic, minimize the interface
  - @roberth: Simple for who? For contributors it would be easy to not have to look at rules declared by e.g. this team
- @Ericson2314: String separation between describing inputs in terms of *needs*, done by the package, and outside world injecting dependencies which satisfy those needs.
- @tomberek: In case we don't want to use automatically used callPackage, have to dig into it, original function is "hidden"
  - @roberth: Would have to use .override, shouldn't dig into unit dirs
  - @infinisil: Could expose unit directories as unstable API point
- @Ericson2314: Overrides are often very related between packages
  - @infinisil: Like python/python3 pattern in all-packages.nix
    - @Ericson2314: Should use version bounds or something like that
- @infinsil: Feels risky expanding something near the end of the RFC drafting.
- @Ericson2314: So the problem we're trying to solve is someone trying to write a unit file, and then they find actually they are outside what units handle, and then they need to start over / do things completely different.
  - @roberth: Yes.
- @Ericson2314: what if we separate units we autocall vs units we don't autocall vs non units?
- @roberth: We could come back to allowing access to unit directories from all-packages.nix
   - So that we don't need args.nix / default.nix / whatever
   - It's more powerful than those solutions
- @tomberek: Allows paying down technical debts, passing arguments is technical debt, have a firewall against technical debt into unit directory
  - @Ericson2314: +1
  - @infinisil: +1

- @tomberek: What if you ask directly for the thing you want, like `pkg-funs.hello-and-cowsay`.
  - @roberth: Doesn't have all the right arguments, needs some duplication
- @roberth: Simple solution: Allow all-packages.nix to call into unit dirs
- `pkgs/unit/foo/foo` and `foo = callPackage ./some/other/dir {}`
- @ericson2314: two dirs
  - manual units (all packages calls)
  - auto units (sharded dir auto-call)
  - all-packages.nix and auto units shoudl be disjoint
- @infinisil: Could do CI check to make sure it's a `callPackage <unit dir>`, not another dir, if there is a unit directory
  - @roberth: config.callPackageDuplicationCheck
  - @infinisil: Generic config.checkNoConflictingAttributes
  - @Ericson2314: Require a `callUnit` not `callPackage`, for now `callUnit = callPackage` or so but presumably would change in the future. Maybe only for CI for now
- @Ericson2314: Put something in unit directory to indicate whether it's being called from all-packages.nix
- @roberth: all-packages.nix is on top of auto called packages in the overlay layering
- Tool should only move attributes without arguments in the callPackage call

Simple solution to just allow all-packages.nix to refer to unit directories with CI checks consensus

### Some code we looked at

- @growpotkin: `pkg-fun.nix` understanding check with variants
Some relatively generic builder similar to `linkFarm`, in this case it builds a package
that symlinks `hello` and `cowsay`, but a variant of the package will add `fzf`.

```
# unit/hell/hello-and-cowsay/pkg-fun.nix
{ stdenv, lndir, paths }:
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "hello-and-cowsay";
  argsList = builtins.concatStringsSep "\n" (
    builtins.attrValues ( builtins.mapAttrs ( t: f:
      "mkdir -p ${t}; lndir ${f} ${t};"
    ) paths )
  );
  passAsFile        = ["argsList"];
  nativeBuildInputs = [lndir];
  buildCommand      = ''. "$argsListPath";'';
}
```

```
# unit/hell/hello-and-cowsay/default.nix
{ pkgs   ? import ../../.. {}
, lib    ? import ../../../lib {}
, stdenv ? pkgs.stdenv
, xorg   ? pkgs.xorg
, lndir  ? xorg.lndir
, hello  ? pkgs.hello
, cowsay ? pkgs.cowsay
, paths  ? { hello = hello.outPath; cow = cowsay.outPath; }
}: lib.makeOverridable ( import ./pkg-fun.nix ) {
  inherit stdenv lndir paths;
}
```

The variant
```
unit/hell/hello-cowsay-and-fzf/default.nix
{ pkgs             ? import ../../.. {}
, stdenv           ? pkgs.stdenv
, xorg             ? pkgs.xorg
, lndir            ? xorg.lndir
, hello            ? pkgs.hello
, cowsay           ? pkgs.cowsay
, fzf              ? pkgs.fzf
, hello-and-cowsay ? pkgs.hello-and-cowsay
, paths            ? {
    hello     = hello.outPath;
    cow       = cowsay.outPath;
    "sub/fzf" = "${fzf}/bin";
  }
}: ( hello-and-cowsay.override {
  inherit stdenv lndir paths;
} ).overrideDrvAttrs ( _: {
  name = "hello-cowsay-and-fzf";
} )
```

## Action items

- everbody: Go through the entire RFC draft in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths and make a PR for anything that needs changing
  - Check here when done: https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/26

- @growpotkin to test https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/23
  - Create flat and sharded directories (with counts 10000, 100000, 1000000)
  - Turn the directories to a single attribute set
    - `hyperfine nix-instantiate --eval -E 'builtins.seq { < the set > } null'`

- @infinisil will continue writing the tooling in https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/22

- @Ericson2314 will talk to the Cargo people on Zulip about sharding. @infinisil will have an account so @Ericson2314 can ping and not be single point of failure.
  - Ask git too, maybe. They do for `.git/objects`.
    - @growpotkin: I'd be shocked if GitHub knew implementation details of `git` objects.
