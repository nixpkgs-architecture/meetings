## Discussion

- @profpatsch/@roberth: Basic mudule system replacement with better performance for packages.
  - @mkaito: Eelco suggested a Nix-based module system
  - @roberth: Somewhat close to the one from Eelco, but simpler, more documented. Should it be integrated? Conflicted, bad for compatibility, won't be able to use from older Nix. First have a prototype with all functionality, only when happy incorporate similar functionality into Nix
  - @john: Move library code into builtins. But we shouldn't get stuck with a bad builtin design. Should have a decision, either libraries or builtins but stable.
    - Nickel is more suitable for experimentation, thouhgh.
  - @ash: What about a separate pure library repo for redesigning it
    - @mkaito: Ran into this before
  - @roberth: Concerned about fragmentation. Some value from refactoring but not fundamental
    - @ash: Flakes to split lib into other repo
    - @roberth: Already automated by someone?
  - @infinisil: Possibility is adding existing lib functions to the builtins
  - @mkaito: What are issues with the module system?
    - @infinisil: 1 Performance, 2 not very clean because of legacy things. Needs to be tidied up before hardcoding it in Nix.
    - @ash: Hardcoding it does not solve the architectural issues. Be careful about changing the language. Performance work may already be underway (?) so not a priority for us now
    - @gytis: Let's ignore the Nix language side of this
    - @mkaito: [Hints at RFC 22]
- @ash: discuss a summary of the previous meeting?
  - @mkaito: have an agenda
  
Summary of previous meeting
 - better phases abstraction. Merge language logic into setup.sh/hooks
 - Gytis used the module system to replace mkDerivation (at Nixlang level)
   - use module system instead of hooks?
   - @DavHau: use it to unify the Nix-level things and setup.sh-level things
   - @DavHau: dream2nix uses module system for some configuration, planned for packaging. Wants to see module system / minimod develop, concerned about lost effort in dream2nix
 - @Gytis: let's present solutions/progress next meeting?
   - bash is still a problem, because especially build input handling is very hard to understand
   - @infinisil: presenting is ok; still something we can discuss
   - @DavHau: define phase as a process with a specified interface; no need to specify language
   - @Alex Ameen: how do these processes interact?
   - @ash: wasn't language discussion out of scope?
   - @infinisil: agreed.
   - @ash: separate matrix channel for topic?
   - @Gytis: gradual or sudden change?
   - @infinisil: gradual, @roberth agrees
   - @John: what process do we want for our changes?
   - @mkaito: but we do have to keep our goals in mind
   - @Gytis: homework: we need to decide gradual / rip-off bandaid
   - @Gytis/@John: this PR simplifies stdenv https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/132343
   - @John: this stuff requires long focused work and learning, not multitasking
   - @Gytis: bootstrapping can be improved, inspired by guix
   - @infinisil: we want to make C/C++ a plugin of a the generic setup.sh
   - @John: removing build input abstraction may simplify the writing of language integrations
   - @Alex Ameen: m4 regeneration is causing headaches. Keep me in the loop. Number of gcc-related patches is scary

- @Gytis: Main issues:
   - Complex bootstrap and dependency trees (PR 132343 is a gateway to clean this all up)
   - Complexity of our bash magic. It needs to be rewritten in an understandable mannner (New language is required)
     - @John: Yeah we can do less in bash, until bash becomes trivial to replace
     - @John: On the other hand. "oil and bash" I don't think has been adiquately discussed :)

## Planning

- Help @JohnEricson with https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/132343
- Reaching contentious on upgrade apprach. Are we ripping bandaid off or is it supposed to be a gradual change (bash compatible or not?)
- It would be super useful to have summary of how Guix does things. Is anyone up to take this as a homework?
