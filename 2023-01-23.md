## Notes

### [Stick to default.nix](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/issues/30)

Arguments brought up by @SuperSandro2000:
- Generally the Fun prefix is used when constructing complex things like package sets like `passthruFun` or `kernelConfigFun`
  - Acknowledged, but not a problem
- Makes the transition needlessly harder
  - People have to learn something new anyways
  - We can have a good error message
  - Good to bundle minor changes to avoid churn
- Every guide on the internet will suddenly be wrong in two ways
- If the package should be build from the cli without the boiler plate code then the following would need to be used
  `nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> {}; callPackage pkgs/unit/hell/hello/pkg-fun.nix {}'`
  
  - @infinisil: The above is an ugly hack
  - @infinisil: Can do good error messages 

  - @roberth: make clear that avoiding `default.nix` for `callPackage` things is a (minor) *goal*, not just an incidental changes.

- If it [also having modules and other package-related Nix files in the unit dirs] isn't the goal of the RFC then it shouldn't be changed to keep the RFC smaller in size and less topics to discuss and bikesheed about.

  - @roberth & @Ericson2314: The "back half" of the RFC (alternatives, future work, etc.) is supposed to discuss the wider context.
  - @infinisil: Still, since we said *do* say we intend to keep the unit directory structure unstable, there isn't a strong reason to "think ahead" like this.
  - @roberth: We could move to "future work" and merely reference in the alternatives section.
  - @Ericson2314: +1


## https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/simple-package-paths/pull/27

- "full variants" (need more files in the same unit) is out of scope
- "light variants" (call the same unit (same `pkg-fun.nix`)) can be in scope.
- No `args.nix` for now
- The requirements are up-to-date but
  - Mention that all-packages should only `callPackage` the `pkg-fun.nix` though, as this is the only public interface of the unit.

## Looking over the automatic draft PR

- `res` is gone!
- beware of case-folding!
  - just need to case-fold sharding dirs
  - the unit dirs themselves can stay original
