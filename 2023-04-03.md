## Notes

### [Modular packages working group](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/working-group-member-search-module-system-for-packages/26574)

- Matrix channel created: https://matrix.to/#/#wg-pkgs-modules:matrix.org
  - Will send when2meet there
- @infinisil will invite team members to the modular package channel
- @nbp's [SOS](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/3) was added to prev work, as well as @pacman99's [POP](https://github.com/divnix/POP)

### [RFC 140](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140) Simple Package Paths

A few comments were made by community members

- [A draft nixpkgs PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/223416) tried to already use the naming convention, which caused some confusion and discussion, but wasn't intended to be merged
  - draft PRs can easily turn into open ones
- Team members becoming shepherds does not appear to be a problem
  - @growpotkin [will nominate](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/140#issuecomment-1494488288) as a shepherd
- @infinisil still has work to do on [the tooling](https://github.com/nixpkgs-architecture/nix-spp) and wants to update the RFC to better describe the PRs and migration process
